# Dabao

Dabao was a peer to peer food delivery applcation running from May 2018 to Apr 2019.

Dabao was built as part of a entrepreneurship grant provided by National University of Singapore.

Avaliable here are the source code for the mobile application of Dabao, built using Flutter. This runs together with the firebase backend which is avaliable in my github. 

The following are screen shots from the application

The code for the mobile application are all located in lib, with some native codes in android and ios, but they are minor modifications for background GPS positioning. The application was built with a reactive architecture in mind, using heavily RXDart 2.0
